# Remote Network Monitor

The motivation of this project is to enable network administrators to scan there local networks from anywhere in the world just with the help of an internet connection. This works by deploying a server in the local network which is resposible to scan the network and the administrators can control the whole process right from scheduling scans to viewing the results with the help of a web-app.

This is the code for the web-app that is responsible for displaying the scan results effective in the form of an interactable GUI. This code makes API calls to the backend server and is responsible for effectively displaying information and interacting with the backend. The code for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/AchyutChaudhary/vulnerability_assessment).
